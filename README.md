# Dermo-Bot-Mini-Project

## Title of the Project
Derma Bot using RAG for Skin Disease Detection

## Small Description
The integration of a derma bot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), aimed at providing efficient and accurate skin disease detection by leveraging real-time image analysis and machine learning techniques.

## About
The Derma Bot using RAG is a project designed to integrate a chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and YOLOv7 for object detection in dermatological applications. Traditional skin disease diagnosis often requires significant manual effort, involving consultations with specialists and physical examinations. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by creating an AI-powered derma bot that utilizes natural language processing and computer vision techniques to assist in diagnosing and addressing user queries.

## Features
Implements YOLOv7 for real-time, high-accuracy object detection and localization.
Utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach for contextual and precise chatbot responses.
High scalability with GPU optimization for faster inference without compromising accuracy.
Efficient integration of feature detection and robust loss functions for improved diagnostic outcomes.
Specific scope of disease detection models using structured JSON data formats for seamless integration.

## Requirements
Operating System:

Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
Development Environment:

Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the derma bot system.
